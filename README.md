# HerokuAppBooking-RestAssured-API-Framework-Mar-06-2025
This is a Rest Assured Automation
# Rest Assured API Testing Project

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use **Rest Assured** to perform API testing for RESTful web services. It automates the testing of API endpoints using HTTP methods such as **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, and **DELETE**, and verifies the correctness of the responses, status codes, headers, and body content.

The project is integrated with **TestNG** (or **JUnit**) for running tests, reporting, and generating test results.

## Features

- **Automated API Tests**: Test multiple API endpoints using Rest Assured.
- **HTTP Method Testing**: Supports various HTTP methods - **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, **DELETE**.
- **Request Validations**: Validate status codes, headers, and response bodies.
- **Response Assertions**: Assert responses with JSON or XML data formats.
- **Data-Driven Testing**: Integrate data from external sources such as JSON files.
- **Test Execution Framework**: Integrate with **TestNG** for structured test execution.
- **Reports**: Detailed reports of the executed tests for easy debugging and tracking.
